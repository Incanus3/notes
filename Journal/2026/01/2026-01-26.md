### Sending custom notifications to editable lists of users
#### What we already have
- `NotificationService.sendCustomNotification()` method
	- can send a notification to recipient, which can be an `EmailRecipient`, which is actually a list of to/cc/bcc email addresses - exactly what we need
	- takes `templateName` and `templateParams`
#### What we'll need
- the ability to store the `EmailRecipient` lists in a db table
- a db table to hold subscriptions
- a functional interface that will turn an `Event` or possibly a `Notification` into `(templateName, templateParams)` + some simple way to register these
	- we'll probably add a custom subclass for each even type, to make the definition simpler for users
