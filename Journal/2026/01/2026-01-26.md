### Sending custom notifications to editable lists of users
#### What we already have
- `NotificationService.sendCustomNotification()` method
	- can send a notification to recipient, which can be an `EmailRecipient`, which is actually a list of to/cc/bcc email addresses - exactly what we need
	- takes `templateName` and `templateParams`
#### What we'll need
- the ability to store the `EmailRecipient` lists in a db table and manage them in the UI
	- a db entity + repository
	- an artifact wrapping the db entity, so that we can use `RegistryController` to manage them
	- a registry viewset + list, create and detail renderers
- a db table to hold subscriptions - these will link an `Event` (+ a resource address wildcard) to
	- the recipient list
	- the custom notification
- a functional interface that will turn an `Event` or possibly a `Notification` into `(templateName, templateParams)` + some simple way to register these
	- we'll probably add a custom subclass for each even type, to make the definition simpler for users
