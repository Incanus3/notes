https://github.com/evzenk/objednavky/commit/5ad9014640ba1c129b83a052bb48bd0bda406919
prepared for creating user along with client
added feature spec
clients/_form translated to haml, for create_user check box we'll need a form
  object as this field shouldn't be in client's model
capybara helpers and shared contexts moved to designated subdir of spec/support

https://github.com/evzenk/objednavky/commit/77ed7db7a41b89fc3c8d67a1013e206760d12348
implemented ClientForm as a wrapper around Client with additional create_user
  attribute, which is compliant with form_for and decent exposure
used it in ClientsController
updated controller spec
added explicit action to destroy button in _object_actions
  this isn't actually needed for ClientForm as it forwards model_name to Client,
  but we may not always wanna do that
