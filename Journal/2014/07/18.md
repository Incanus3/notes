      extracted MessageHandling from MessageHandler
      - since new instance is created for every message, the message may be stored
        in instvar eliminating the need to pass it between methods
      - listeners also need to be created for each message, when stored in
        MessageHandler instvar, they could survive to next message handling, causing
        hard-to-find bugs
      MessageHandler now only handles logic between receipts (unsubscribing upon
        critical errors, retrying upon recoverable ones)
