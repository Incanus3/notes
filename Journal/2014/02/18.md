- prace - alto = 5h
  - 6-7 - started modifying menu_controller_spec to test selected canteen,
      which will be stored in session and selected in form (if allowed for client)
    canteen_id, chain_id and employer_id params aren't required in ClientsControll
      any more
    ClientsController calls valid? on client instead of persisted?, otherwise
      validation errors aren't shown
