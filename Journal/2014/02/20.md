- prace - alto = 1h
  - 4.30-4.45 - made wellcome and terminals resourceful
  - 5-5.45 - tested Client::Update service
    User::Create and User::Update returns client even when associations can't be
    found, which is nice because we can render form with the invalid user, but
    if an optional association isn't found, we don't learn about it, which is
    dangerous
    - the services should probably set validation errors on associations that
      weren't found
