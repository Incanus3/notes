    - WIP: uncovered problem with testing meal unordering using capybara
      the unorder button is stuffed into the meal ordering form (which already
        has one submit button) and hacked to work using formaction
      this is probably bad, but we need the button to appear inside of the form
      the other possibility is not to set formaction and have a test for commit param
        (button text) in the action, thus to have same action being called for two
        different operations, which is bad too
      another option is to use javascript for this, which may be needed later anyway
      the hack is in app/helpers/menu_helper.rb
