# Passenger
Please edit your Apache configuration file, and add these lines:

LoadModule passenger_module /usr/local/rvm/gems/ruby-2.1.1@global/gems/passenger-4.0.40/buildout/apache2/mod_passenger.so
<IfModule mod_passenger.c>
  PassengerRoot /usr/local/rvm/gems/ruby-2.1.1@global/gems/passenger-4.0.40
  PassengerDefaultRuby /usr/local/rvm/gems/ruby-2.1.1@global/wrappers/ruby
</IfModule>

Suppose you have a web application in /somewhere. Add a virtual host to your
Apache configuration file and set its DocumentRoot to /somewhere/public:

<VirtualHost *:80>
   ServerName www.yourhost.com
   # !!! Be sure to point DocumentRoot to 'public'!
   DocumentRoot /somewhere/public
   <Directory /somewhere/public>
      # This relaxes Apache security settings.
      AllowOverride all
      # MultiViews must be turned off.
      Options -MultiViews
   </Directory>
</VirtualHost>


=== Ember.js ===
- template - html with handlebars script with id
  - is backed by model (which can be anything)
- router - binds urls to templates
- route - specifies which model a template should be backed by
  - defines model method, which returns the model
- controller - stores application state, responds to events from templates


- Object model
  - extend - creates subclass, takes object that defines global attributes
  - create - creates instance of the object, can take object whose attributes
    will be the base for the new object
