    registration form now keeps values and shows validation errors even if client
      with given card_id wasn't found
    - #build_resource builds new client with given attributes
    - #create calls fix_card_id_error which sets error on :card_id to :not_found if
      card id given but client not found
    - tested
    used expose for registration context
    added Client, User and Order Decorators
    - added ClientDecorator#full_name
    - ClientsHelper#client_link moved to ClientDecorator#link
    - updated views, controllers and specs

    set correct registration field types
    - added type optional parameter to RegistrationContextDecorator#field
