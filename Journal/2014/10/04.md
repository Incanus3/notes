    added balances to transaction history
    - extended view
    - exposed balances in controller
    - added Transaction.money, .point and .last_of_kind class methods
    - BootstrapHelper#page_header now accepts block
    added validations to Transaction
    Transaction.primary_key needs to be set explicitly, since table was created with
      id: false, because id needs to be bigserial
    updated db/migrate subrepo

    made test suite green again
    - except searchlogic and ImportProperties tests
    - fixed some requires
    - updated FactoryGirl calls, removed unneccessary creations
    - added paperclip_database
    - fixed call to errors.add in Collection#can_be_archived?
    - added missing spaces to Property.changed_ids query
    fixed ImportProperties spec
    - resources are created instead of built
    - added 1 to expected errors for missing values, because of overlapping
      validation of date of purchase - presence and format
    - validation errors are now properly added to errors array
    - row indices now start at 1 for first record (instead of 2 because of headers)
    updated ImportProperties
    - no need to find associations using find_by_...!, since required associations
      are checked by valid?
