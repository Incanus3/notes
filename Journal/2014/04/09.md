  - 2.30-4.30
    - server-management
      - split shared examples to serveral files
      - split shared contexts to serveral files
      - removed old notes
      - MySQLObject now stores mysql connection in class variable
        this way the connection is persisted and shared between all instances of
        descendants
      - MySQLObject no longer delegates methods starting with mysql_ to connection,
        tasks calls methods directly on connection
      - updated specs to clear stored connection between examples, otherwise tests that
        use unprivileged users, bad passwords, etc. wouldn't fail

  - 6.15-7.15
    - tasks
      - moved files and system_users to tasks/system
    - server-management
      - installed rvm and ruby for root
      - enabled webhosting specs
      - updated Webhosting to use new tasks file structure and method names
      - fixed bug in create_apache_conf - config local variable shadowed config method
      - added no_root exclusion filter to be used when running specs as root
        webhosting specs must be run as root, since they access system directories
        but some other specs test that proper errors are raised when file permissions
        are missing, which doesn't work for root

  - 7.45-8.45
    - tasks
      - started testing of Tasks::System::Users
        - created Server::System as canonical includer of Tasks::System submodules
        - tested get_uid, get_gid, get_user_home, user_exists?
        - made user_exists? more resilient by matching against first part of the
          /etc/passwd line instead of against whole line

      - fully tested Tasks::System::Users
      - added group_exists?, delete_user, delete_group

  - 9.30-10.30
    - tasks
      - tested Tasks::System::Files
    - server-management
      - updated WebHosting spec
        tests creation of document root, config and link manually, instead of just
        expecting the creation method to be called

  - 11.30-12.15
    - server-management
      - tested correct options in vhost config
        basedir is now computed in code, not in template
        basedir is used to infer Directory directive path
