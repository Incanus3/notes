    StoredRelation#stored_relation now returns nil if
      any of the components (client, chain) seized to exist
    - added ClientCanteenRelation#reload and #components_exist?
    stored_relation is now memoized
    prepared hook for setting stored_relation to terminal_canteen after login
    updated specs

    refactored ClientCanteenRelation

    added ClientCanteenRelation::Base, ::Direct and
      ::Indirect to avoid testing direct? in every instance method
    - updated StoredRelation (the only one who needs to know about this change)
    simplified RelationPresenter spec

    extracted specs for ClientCanteenRelation::Direct
      and ::Indirect from ClientCanteenRelation spec
    tested ClientCanteenRelation.from_ids

    ordering controllers now check relation existence
      much more efficiently, relying on current_canteen and falling back to
      ClientCanteenRelation.any_exists? when meal.canteen != current_canteen
      (e.g. when ordering from duplicated tab after selecting another canteen)

    tested login after related canteen/chain was deleted
    - added dependent: :delete_all to Canteen# meals, #client_relations,
      #chain_relations, Chain#client_relations and #canteen_relations
    - added default type to Relation.create

    tested clearing of both direct and indirect stored
      relation after login if relation or any of its components no longer exist
