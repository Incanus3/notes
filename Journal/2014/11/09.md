- prace - alto
  - 3.30-4.30
    simplified ChainCanteenRelations.canteens_of() and .chains_of()
    - added BaseModel.with_ids(ids)

    simplified ChainCanteenRelations.canteens_of() and chains_of() even more
    - added and inherited from JoinBase class
    - moved .create() and .delete_all() there
      - .create() now takes keyword arguments for columns (as does BaseModel)
    - added JoinBase._values_for(result_column, where_column, value)
      - used in .canteens_of() and .chains_of()
    - updated tests

    reformatted
    - fixed vim indentation to braces
