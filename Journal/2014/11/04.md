- prace - alto
  - 2-4.30
    extracted getting clients from database to Clients model
    - handlers should never touch database directly, that's models' responsibility
    extracted common model behavior to BaseModel
    extracted common crud handler behavior to ResourceHandler and ResourcesHandler

    scatched basic BaseModel functionality and design
    - added interface definition and notes

    added basic test structure
    - added tests directory
    - added TestCase
      - provides get_app() for tornado.testing.AsyncHTTPTestCase
      - provides get_json(path) for subclasses
        - fetches response for path and decodes it from json
        - only get method and no params for now
    - added ClientsTest
      - subclasses TestCase
      - calls inherited get_json('/clients')
      - prints and validates response

    TestCase.get_json() now supports additional kwargs
      for http request (mainly method) but params must still be encoded in path

    TestCase.fetch() and .get_json() now support params dict
