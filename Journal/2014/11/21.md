    serialized attributes are now wrapped in OpenStructs so that nested fields_for
      can be prefilled from them
    - added OpenStructSerialization model concern
    - included into Client and used for personal and address attributes

    validation errors are now correctly rendering for serialized attributes
    - attributes are now represented as objects providing their own validations
    - added ObjectSerialization model concern and NestedAttributes class
    - included into Client
    - added Personal and Address classes subclassing NestedAttributes and defining
      validations
    - used serialize_as_object for personal and address

    instead of wrapping serialized attributes after initialization
      ObjectSerialization and OpenStructSerialization override attribute writes and
      attributes are wrapped on each write
