### mocks
RSpec.configure do |config|
  config.mock_with :rspec do |mocks|
    mocks.verify_partial_doubles = true
  end
end
- will check when mocking/stubbing a method, that it actually existed
expect(MyClass).to receive(:some_message)
- or use instance_double, class_double and object_double explicitly
https://relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-mocks/v/3-0/docs/verifying-doubles

- any instance alternative implementation yields the object as first arg
allow_any_instance_of(Employee).to receive(:salary) do |employee, currency|
  usd_amount = 50_000 + (10_000 * employee.years_worked)
  currency.from_usd(usd_amount)
end

employee = Employee.find(23)
salary = employee.salary(Currency.find(:CAD))
### rails
- spec type inference from path disabled by default, enable it using
RSpec.configure do |config|
  config.infer_spec_type_from_file_location!
end

- or use metadata explicitly
RSpec.describe ThingsController, type: :controller do
  # Equivalent to being in spec/controllers
end

- mock_model and stub_model extracted into rspec-activemodel-mocks

- define methods for mock controller in controller specs
