    added exceptions for NotFound and BadRequest
    added common error handling to routes
    used these exceptions in bill_open
    - model shouldn't be concerned with presentation logic
    - method is aborted when exception raised - we don't need to return
      explicitly

    - zkoumani bill_put a evzova podezreleho requestu

  - 5-7.30
    added tests for /bill_put exception cases
    extracted write_bill, write_items, write_payments and write_header from
      Eskacka#bill_put
    error retvals changed to exception raises, this way they can appear in helper
      methods
    added error message to retval in BadRequest error handler

    split eskacka_spec to eskacka/bill_open_spec and eskacka/bill_put_spec

    added pending specs for untested bill_put functionality

    extracted column arrays to constants
    added write_record helper which prepairs row and then writes it to dataset

    used class << self instead of extend self since we don't include the module

    added tests for saving of items, payments and header in bill_put
    moved constants out of class << self
    added note about broken write_header
