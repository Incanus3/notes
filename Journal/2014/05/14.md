    simplified routes using params helpers
    - added params helper - symbolized_params
    - added parsing helper - parse_json_hash_array - can be used in parse_param(s)
      - checks that param is json array of hashes - no need to check in model
    - ModelBase.ensure_hash_type renamed to ensure_columns, since type is checked
      route
    - used in routes
    - updated specs
