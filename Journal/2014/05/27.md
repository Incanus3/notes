- Faraday is an HTTP client lib that provides a common interface over many
  adapters (such as Net::HTTP) and embraces the concept of Rack middleware when
  processing the request/response cycle.  It also includes a Rack adapter for
  hitting loaded Rack applications through Rack::Test, and a Test adapter for
  stubbing requests by hand.
