    simplified mysql integration specs
    - the no longer set up prerequisites for each test (users, databases, rights,
      ...) and assert real changes
    - instead they mock (or stub) commands called on mysql_server (which includes
      all mysql tasks)
    - databases, users and rights specs no longer need mysql server to be running,
      management users to be present, etc.
    - MySQLHelpers are no longer needed
    - shared examples and most of shared contexts are no longer needed
