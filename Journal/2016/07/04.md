== Pitch ==

- pitch - tón (výška tónu)
- note  - nota (zápis tónu)
- staff - notová osnova
  - lines and spaces
  - ledger lines - pomocné linky
- clef  - klíč
  - 4 modern clefs:
    - treble clef (houslový) - c1 on the first ledger line under
    - alto clef              - c1 on the middle line
    - tenor clef             - c1 on the second-top line
    - bass clef              - c1 on the first ledger line above
- accidentals - znaménka
  - alter the note by one or two half steps
  - double sharp - raise by two half steps
  - sharp        - raise by one half step
  - natural      - cancel previous accidental
  - flat         - lower by one half step
  - double flat  - lower by two half steps
- enharmonics - two notes with the same pitch - e.g. f-sharp and g-flat

== Rhythm ==

- note length is indicated by a system of noteheads, stems and flags
- rest - pomlka
- augmentation dot - tečka (prodlužuje o polovinu)
  - can be repeated - 2 dots mean 1 + 1/2 + 1/4
- tie - connects two notes together to create single extended sound
  - to tie more than two notes, draw tie btw each pair

== Meter ==

- beat, consisting of beat units (doby?)
  - simple beat units   - contain two divisions   - half = 2 * quarter
  - compound beat units - contain three divisions - half with dot = 3 * quarter
- measure - takt
- barline - delineates measures
- meter - organization of beat units and measures in a piece
  - described by time signature - two numbers at the beginning
  - simple time signature
    - top number    - number of beats in a measure
    - bottom number - type of note serving as beat unit
    - e.g. 3/4 - 3 beats per measure, each beat delimited by a quarter note
  - compound time signature
    - top number    - 3 * number of beats
    - bottom number - type of note serving as the division - beat unit is equal to three of these
      notes
    - e.g. 6/8
      - 2 beats per measure (^--^--)
      - eighth note = the division - 6 eigth notes in a measure
      - beat unit   = 3 eighth notes
- notes can be grouped together by using beams instead of flags
- group (with ties or beams) only notes within a beat (unit)
