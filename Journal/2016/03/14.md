  - instalace nginx + passenger na hosted ds
  - konfigurace rvm v bashi tak, aby fungovalo i v tmuxu

  - promysleni refactoru evens controlleru


event list view is way too complex
- we could extract some of the logic into helpers, but that is ugly in general and even more so
  when the helpers need to call helpers defined in the controller
- it would probably be wiser to introduce an EventList view model along with a decorator and move
  logic from both controller and view there
- one problem here is that we already started making changes in EventsController towards
  optimizing the event list page
- this optimization will need the EventList object too, but if we start changing the controller in
  master, it will be hard to merge the changes
-> update the changes so that they can be merged now, then build on them
