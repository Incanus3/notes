  WIP: fixed 'add to cart' and 'preorder' count input limits and defaults
  - limits were not working, when upper limit was 0
  - default was still 1 when upper limit was 1
  - but it's now possible to create 0 count registration
  moved more logic from events#index views to decorators
  - added EventListItem struct and its decorator
  - added EventListItemDecorator#product_link, #free_capacity, #add_to_cart_count_input and
    #preorder_count_input
  - greatly simplified views by calling these
  - added EventListDecorator#items
  - client's cart is now passed to view as part of EventList
  this should also simplify further optimizations
  - free_capacities should be preloaded and this will be easier, if the logic is in decorators

  registration submits are now disabled on zero free capacity
  joined event_actions_client and event_actions_admin partials into one
