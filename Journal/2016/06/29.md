  - problem s required boolean fieldem
  - problem s partial updaty

- django.forms.fields.BooleanField has special required behavior
  - if required = True, it validates, that the passed value is true
  - if required = False, it defaults to false
  - this probably makes sense, since the intended use-case is for HTML form posted data - in this
    case a checkbox which posts no data when unchecked
  - how do we ensure that value is actually passed to the form?
  - the strange thing is, model BooleanField always has blank = True, even when blank = False is
    passed, so in the default BooleanField() form where NOT NULL constraint is created, creating
    model with unspecified boolean field raises no validation error when calling full_clean(), but
    raises IntegrityError when saving to db

- rest framework - PUT requires all required params again, even if they're already present in the
  model
  - this is because ModelSerializer behaves in this way - when given both instance and data, it
    expects the required attribute in data even when it's already present in instance
  - this is possible with partial serializers
    - serializer class can't be made partial by default
    - we need to pass partial = True on serializer instantiation
    -> for ModelViewSet
      - either subclass and override get_serializer to pass in partial = True
      - or use PATCH method, which does partial update by default
