=== Thu, 23.6. ===

- 2-4.30 - studium django-rest-framework
- 4.30-10.30
  - alto-view-utils
    added full_width_horizontal_form_for
    - added simple_form settings - no longer needed in apps as initializers
    - simplified BootstrapHelper#inline_form_for and #horizontal_form_for using _merge_form_options
    - default offset for offset_form_group (and callers) can be set in simple_form wrapper settings
      -> visual settings are in one place
      -> when we change them, all forms change accordingly
    added boolean and fake_boolean input types to custom_form_for and derivates ()
    - labels finaly work as expected - right from checkbox, no overlapping
    - fake_boolean input name now includes form object name
      -> clicking on label correctly toggles checkbox
    - removed CustomFormBuilder#checkbox - no longer needed
    updated ruby version

  - alto_rails_auth
    login and registration form type is now customizable
    - added #form_for to LoginContextDecorator and RegistrationContextDecorator
    - used in views
    registration form fieldsets are now nested in divs with useful classes
    - can be styled when panels aren't rendered
    used 'CustomFormBuilder#input 'remember_me', as: :boolean' instead of CustomFormBuilder#checkbox
    - works correctly after updating alto-view-utils
    updated dependencies

  - rezervace
    WIP: started adding joined auth
    - updated alto_rails_auth and alto-view-utils to support full width horizontal forms
      - otherwise inputs are too small when there are two forms next to each other
      - moved simple from configuration and FakeBooleanInput to alto-view-utils
      - fixed trade terms accepting
      - updated RegistrationContextDecorator
    - added routes, JoinedAuthController, new_non_makro view and navbar link
    - added LoginContext with decorator
    updated and renamed stylesheets
    - dropped deprecated .css subextension form scss files
    added bin/lserver.sh to start server with local gems checked out
