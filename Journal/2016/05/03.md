- 16.30-23

- backend
  added mass many-to-many relationship setter
  - e.g. route POST /groups/:group_id/articles now accepts a list of ids and sets group.articles
    to articles found by given ids
  JoinHandler now sorts array of related record ids

  cleaned up JoinHandler
  - removed old comments
  - extracted _subquery helper method

  updated route documentation

  added routes to return record with added related record ids
  - e.g. get /actions/:action_id/with_buildings
  added routes to return lists of related record ids
  - e.g. get /actions/:action_id/building_ids
  - mass related record setting is now handled by post on these routes
  - updated route documentation

- frontend
  updated to newest react and react-bootstrap
  - used explicit from groups, labels and controls instead of deprecated Input
  -> gives us more control - allows for validation states, helper texts, etc.
  simplified change handling in ActionForm - input and select helpers now extract value from event
  added dateInput helper - translates date from and to string
  simplified utils.arrayEqual

  fixed action start and end setting
  - added moment and moment-timezone
  - inputs now validate datetime format, show validation state (colors) and format help text
  - date values are correctly converted btw
    - internal date objects
    - display strings (omit spurious zeros)
    - input strings (fixed lengths - includes zeros)
    - backend JSON format (wo timezone info - assume utc)
  fixed group management to use custom HorizontalInput instead of deprecated Input

  changed action buildings are now persisted in one AJAX request
  - added Model.set<related record>s(ids) instance method

  HorizontalInput no longer renders HelpBlock if helpText not given

  ActionForm now validates nonempty name and valid dates
  - when value is invalid, field is marked and submit is disabled
  simplified map utils

  extended and normalized Model and ModelProxy interfaces
  - added Model.find - fetches record by id
  - renamed ModelProxy.find to .findLoaded - it only searches the identity map, same as .allLoaded
  - added ModelProxy.find - actually fetches and stores the record if it is not loaded yet
  - marked private methods
  - removed old comments
  hasMany now defines fetch<related model>s - loads the related object ids
  added notes about (re)loading of relations after find/create/update

  fixed group articles and action buildings reloading after group/action update
  - after updating the group/action, the record was loaded (and cached) without the related ids
  - reloading all groups with articles and actions with buildings for now
  fixed Model.clone() - it didn't copy the prototype
  -> cloned objects returned by ModelProxy lacked relation methods
  mapping relation methods through Repository.register is now simpler
  - it expects related class instead of loading method name
  - this also allows us to define further methods
  -> added ModelProxy.fetch<related object>sFor
