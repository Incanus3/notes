- 17.30-18 - rozbehnuti envify na serveru
- 21.15-1.15 - inicializace stavu z url

- reselect memoized selectors would be ideal to filter articles
https://github.com/reactjs/reselect

- convenient location is accessible only through props passed to route components, not outside of
  them - browserHistory provides url mutation methods, but not reading methods
- we could dispatch some action from component's willMount/didMount hook, but this seems unclean
  since the initialization from url params should happen only once after loading data from backend
- we could also use browserHistory.listen to get location in callback, but that also doesn't seem
  very clean
- we could enhance history using e.g. history library, but since react-router's browserHistory and
  history's history provide mostly the same methods (at least for mutating url), it is unclear,
  which of these will be called and if history's methods are called (e.g. push) they are less
  convenient then browserHistory's methods, since the e.g. need whole query string instead of params
  object
- or we could use some non-react-router solution, but most of the URI parsing solutions are either
  outdated or don't parse query string to params object
