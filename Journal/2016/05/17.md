  WIP: GroupManagement data are stored in store
  - added actions, creators and reducers
  - GroupManagement component is now stateless, all loading and selection is done throught store
  - all management functionality is now disabled
  - ActionManagement is broken
  - async Model methods no longer take callbacks, instead they return promises
    - this way we can return the promises from async actions and wait on them
  - Model relationships now work through store instead of Repository
    - store must be attached to Model (or subclasses)

  group creation now works again
  - added action types, creator and reducer branch
  - action creator passed to GroupManagement mapDispatchToProps and called in createGroup handler
  initialization and resets of group article selection are no longer handled by GroupManagement
  - instead they are handled in INIT_GROUP_MNG_SELECTION and SELECT_GROUP reducer branches

  group deletion works again

  moved group selection, creation and deletion logic from GroupManagement to GroupManager
  - GroupManager is now connected to store

  group updating works again
  - group can't be selected when create/update form is shown

  when group name already exists, createGroup and updateGroup show sensible alert

  adding article to group works again
  - Model#add<relation>, #remove<relation> and #set<relation>s no longer modify receiver after
    persisting the changes on server
  - instead, they pass updated clone to the promise success handlers

  removing article from group works again

  article filtering works again
  - filtering is now done on client side
  fixed group updating

  turned reducers into classes
  - there is a method for each action type, which is dispatched by converting action.type to
    camelCase
  split actions and reducers into several files
  fixed and simplified Model.create and .update

  moved loadGroupManagementData hook to GroupManager
  moved articleSelected, filterArticles and resetArticleFilters to ArticleManager
  moved groupArticleSelected and removeArticleFromGroup to ArticleGroupAssignmentManager
  GroupManagement component is now trivial - moved to main.coffee
  squashed react-bootstrap requires

  loadGroupManagementData action is no longer dispatched when GroupManager is mounted
  - instead it's dispatched manually right after store is created
  deleted unused GroupRepository
