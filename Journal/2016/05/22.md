=== Sun, 22.5. ===

- 12-2am - globus-bonus
  - dokoncena synchronizace stavu a url - back/forward funguji dle ocekavani

  browser back/forward buttons work as expected
  - added onLocationChange helper
  - history updates aren't emited during onLocationChange handling, otherwise this would loop forever
  - added handleLocationChange function, receives store, called by main
  - split initStateFromParams into initGroupMngStateFromParams and initActionMngStateFromParams so
    that they may be called separately for each route (otherwise we'd lose group mng state when
    navigating to action mng page and vice versa)
  - filtering/paginating actions are always dispatched by initGroupMngStateFromParams - even whe they
    reset to defaults - otherwise resets couldn't be undone/redone
  - initGroup/ActionMngParamsFromState now replaces params - we don't need two back/forward clicks to
    undo/redo page change
  - FilterForm updates state on property changes
