=== backend permission system ===

- permissions are mostly given to groups
- client users are given group memberships
- some default group(s) should be created and all existing client users should be made members
  - default groups will be set by project-level setting
  - they will be created via a standard data migration and if the default group set ought to change,
    a new migration will be created
- groups should have permissions defined by project-level setting
  - these will be assigned using an after-migrate hook because
    1) permissions are created in after-migrate hook, so we can't rely on them being present during
       migration application
    2) permissions need to be adjustable per deployment (when this is needed, the setting will be
       loaded from config), so this can't be a part of the common migration process
- newly created users should be given group membership either by specifying the group set in the
  request, or falling back to the default groups set

- test that
  - on project level
    - default groups and permissions are created
    - existing users are added to default groups
  - in auth app (because that's the one that provides /auth/crud/users routes)
[*] - newly created users are given default group memberships if group set not given
[*] - newly created users are given custom group memberships
      - override settings for test and create groups manually in setup
[*] - users have permissions according to their groups
      - tests the have_permission route
[*] - get_(client/terminal)_token includes list of user's permissions
