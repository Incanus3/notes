== Entity storage in new cash register ==

- permanent storage with versioning and some intelligent refreshing
  + fast when no update is needed (when is that anyway?)
  - hard to keep up-to-date
  - need to prune storage regularly s.t. memory doesn't run out
  - more complex reads - need to merge new data into old one
  - need to replicate big part of backend logic - filtering, ordering, pagination
- short-term storage needed only for current screen                 <--- use this for now
  - slower - almost every screen switch means backend requests
  + much simpler to keep data up-to-date
  + less conflicts on writes

- store inside component
  - must pass down to children
  - more complex components
  - store distributed over the whole app
  - too much logic in components
  -> lose all pros of redux
- store in state.entities
- store in component-specific state
  - is there a reason to have different sets of the same entity classes loaded at the same time?
    - probably not, so state.entities makes more sense
