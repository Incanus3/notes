- 1pm-10pm
  - WIP adding user activation through tokens
    - studied django mailing, full url generation, celery
    - started studying django token solution for password reset
  - makro certificate migration
    + fixes to configuration (nginx proxy headers, rails X-Frame-Options headers)
    - spent some time updating rezervace and related gems, but it would take too much time to
      create a working environemnt - solved with hotfix now, since app will be deprecated anyway
