- 3pm-1am
  - WIP adding user activation through tokens
    - studied django token solution for password reset, copied with slight changes
    - properly tested user registration and deletion
    - struggled with deciding whether to put user activation in kredit (which implements client
      registration for now through additional detail_routes on crud viewset) or alto_auth (since it
      doesn't touch client and is technically an authorization functionality)
    - decided to split alto_auth into base_auth and client_auth
