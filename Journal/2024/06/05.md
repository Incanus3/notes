=== invalidating loaded properties - debug ===

- BeanState.setPropertyLoaded() calls EntityBeanIntercept.setPropertyLoaded(), this is implemented
  in InterceptReadWrite.setPropertyLoaded() so that it sets (or unsets) the FLAG_LOADED_PROP for
  flags[position]
- InterceptReadWrite.flags is an array of bytes, one for each property position, individual bits are
  extracted by ANDing with 2-base numbers (exactly one 1 bit, rest is 0)
- FLAG_LOADED_PROP is then used by:
  - isPartial()
  - hasIdOnly()
  - isLoadedProperty() - this is probably what we care about
  - setNewBeanForUpdate()
  - loadedPropertyNames()
  - loaded()
  - loadBeanInternal()
- it is also set by:
  - setReference()
  - setLoadedProperty(), setPropertyUnloaded(), setLoadedPropertyAll()
  - initializedMany()
  - setLoadError()
