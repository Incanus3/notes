=== diagram checklist ===

- container padding should respect connections
  - only respect those that start AND end inside the container
  - later improve for nested containers - render from inside out
- improve edge labels:
  - find longest segment (if there are at least 3, skip first and last), position label in its middle
  - don't render ɐɯɐɥou nɹůɥzʌ
  - respect color
- when connection points don't fit next to / below each other, reuse existing, ideally with the same
  arrowhead, and keep respecting obstacles. in this case, the final segments will overlap
- respect connection points if they're specified. if needed, round to closest grid point
- support autoSize + padding for the whole Image(Viewer)Widget
- save diagram as image
- optimize edge router
- fix auto-centering
  - add center button?
