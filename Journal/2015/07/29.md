- 12-2 - rezervace
  added Orders.pay_by_card, .abort_payment and .fail_payment
  - instead of returning InvalidOrderState, these may raise InvalidOrderStateError
    - wrong order state should never happen here
  - added notes about the necessity of asynchronous bill updates
  simplified payments#handle using Orders.pay_by_card and .abort_payment
  - also logs and raises error for unhanlded payment failure
  updated UnfinishedOrderCloser to call Orders service
  added Bills#update_immediately
  - updated mongo-sk-client - added BillSender#send_bill_update!
  - probably won't be used, since most updates must be asynchronous (see Orders service)
  renamed cancel_payment event to abort_payment, payment_cancelled state to payment_aborted
  - cancel is ambiguous - could mean abort (cancel preemptively) or revoke (cancel afterwards)
  renamed payment_failed event to fail_payment for consistency
  updated specs
