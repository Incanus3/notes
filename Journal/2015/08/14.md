  only superadmin may access administration
  - updated AdministrationPolicy
  - updated alto_rails_auth - AdminAuth#check_admin_user now calls User#privileged?
  - overrided User#privileged? to be true for both admin and superadmin
  removed Cart#closed? and simplified all code calling it
  - cart was closed either for NoClient.new.cart or when cart.order.payment_failed?
    - first case handled by empty?
    - second case can no longer happen - cart works only with unpayed orders
  - removed most of the checks
  - the rest is handled either by Cart#empty? or by checking if client is selected
  created superadmin in db/seeds
