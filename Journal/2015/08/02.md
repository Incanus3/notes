  PaymentHelpers#fake_successful_payment stubs Bills#generate_immediately

- 9.15-1.15
- 2.45-3.15
  added ReversalOrder and ReversalRegistration non-AR models
  - each stores original AR model (order or registration) and finds or creates the reversal AR-model
    on demand
  - they delegate some methods to the original and some to the reversal AR models, greatly simplifying
    the calling code (mostly views)
  - ReversalOrder also serves as a cache for lookup of reversal AR registration, otherwise they'd need
    to be looked up for each ReversalRegistration instance
  - tested
