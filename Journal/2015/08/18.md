- 1-9 - rozsekani datastore
  - tornado_utils
    CommonResourceHandler.join_index now handles nonexistent filtering attribute
    added utils

    fixed filtering by date
    - filtering was done between midnights inclusive, so 2015-01-02T00:00:00 was included in results
      when filtering for 2015-01-01

  - datastore_common
    initial commit
    - extracted common models and handlers from datastore_py
    - included migrations and tests for common models and handlers

    fixed client-transaction circular dependency
    - moved Client.check_transactions definition to transaction file

  - datastore_rezervace
    initial commit
    - extracted makro rezervace handlers and models from mixed datastore

  - datastore_food
    extracted common models and handlers to datastore_common
    extracted makro rezervation models and handlers to datastore_rezervace
    - updated imports
    fixed chain-client circular dependency - moved client relations methods from chain to client
    - without loading client, chain knows nothing about clients
