  implemented finding of bakare clients by card during registration

  - added sessions#(new|create)_by_card
    - added routes, controller actions, view for new_by_card, translation

    - added Client.find_by_email_and_card (non-bang)

- 19.30-23.30 - objednavky - prihlaseni cislem karty
  refactored conditional client finding and conditional logic depending on chain setting in general

    - provides #svetozor?, #bakare?, az?, generic?
    - methods can be called on module or included
    - simplified RegistrationContext
  - extracted ClientFinder query object
    - provides #find_by_card(!) and #find_by_email_and_card(!)
    - encapsulates conditional card finding logic depending on chain setting
    - simplified RegistrationContext and Client
  disabled login on terminal specs, fixed the rest

  started testing login by card
