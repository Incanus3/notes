- 11-3 - makro - datastore
  /event/:id/registrations now returns shortcuts for order_state
  - added migration to create order_shortcuts table and bulk insert values
  - added OrderShortcut model
  - added @state.expression which returns subselect

  MakroOrder.state now fully depends on order_shortcuts table
  - we don't need to keep the shortcuts table and mapping in code in sync
  - StateComparator looks up state name in shortcuts table
  - defined _state_shortcut as relation with StateOrderShortcut
  - state hybrid property delegates to _state_shortcut
  - state setter updates _state_shortcut
  - tested
  fixed DeclarativeBase._transform_condition (called from where)
  - checks that attribute has a type before testing the type, since hybrid attributes and association
    proxies don't have a type
  - StateComparator.__init__ override no longer necessary

- 3.30-7.30 - makro - datastore
  fixed filtering by order state
  - failed when more order than one state were was used in orders table
  - instead of @state.expression, overrided StateComparator.__clause_element__
    - returns order_shortcuts.shortcut column
    - must be used only when tables are already joined
  - added join to EventRegistrationsHandler.get()
  - updated test

- 7-9 - makro - datastore
  - posledni upravy, update na testingu, nasazeni na production
