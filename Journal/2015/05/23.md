finished adding explicit cart entity …
- moved registrations#index to cart#show
- moved registrations#create to cart#add_item
- moved registrations#destroy to cart#remove_item
moved non-administration resources outside of consumer namespace
- doesn't make much sense, since they're accessible for both admin and client
updated specs
removed old notes

fixed registration administration after moving client association to order
removed old code

cart can now be emptied …
- added 'empty cart' button
- implemented CartController#empty
- implemented Cart#empty!
- tested
added shortcutting states for Order#state
orders state now defaults to unpayed
order can't be destroyed when payment attempted
unminified makro css, updated btn-danger

Cart#add_item increments count for already registered event …
- doesn't check capacity yet, but view input has limit
events#index shows number of registered events
