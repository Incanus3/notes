    refactoring before extraction of common features
    HashWrapper.wraps now takes mapping from names to shortcuts
    HashWrapper methods now raise exceptions for invalid name or shortcut
    AttributeAliasing.wrap_attribute now optionally defines validation, predicates and scopes
    - used for Transaction::Kind, simplified other callers - used new options
    inlined wrapped attribute classes in models (Meal::Course, Transaction::Kind, ...)
    moved methods from presenters to decorators - got rid of presenters
    moved persistence logic from CanteenDecorator to Canteen
    updated Transactions controller and view after changing column names
