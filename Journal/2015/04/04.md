    transaction create now recalculates balances
    - transactions of the same client and kind are recalculated
    - tested
    required_fields element can now be array of options, e.g. ['client', 'client_id']
    Transaction now uses custom Query subclass to add chainable scopes
    used backref for all one-to-many relationships
    - avoids some circular dependency problems
    - relation query_class parameter doesn't accept callable
