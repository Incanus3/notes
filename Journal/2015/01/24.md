=== Sat, 24.1. ===

- prace - alto
  - 10-12.30
    simplified events#index view
    - got rid of rows and columns
    - moved event attribute rendering to its decorator
    - used active_if helper (moved from NavbarHelper to ApplicationHelper)

    added admin role, which can register event for any client
    - added role to User (enum)
    - added name to Client (validated)
    - added client select to registration form if admin
    - added client column to registrations table if admin
    - EventsController passes available clients to view
    - RegistrationsController uses either current_user.client and its registrations,
      or all registrations and client_id from form
    - updated seeds
    - tested

    added foreign key
    updated user bar - shows name for client, admin (email) for admin

    admin can add comment to registration
    - added migration
    - added field to view
    - controller passes comment to client.register
    - client.register passes comment to registrations.create!
    - tested
    changed t.index to add_index in all migrations

  - 1.15-2.45
    client select field is now searchable
    - added chosen-rails gem, required in application.js and .css
    - added coffee function to apply chosen to any .chosen-select elements
    - added chosen-select class to client select

    fixed bug - register button was hidden for normal user
    searching is now disabled if there's less than 10 clients

  - 6.15-7.15
    admin events table now shows form in next row
    - fixed spec
    since there were now 3 tests for adminhood, extracted events table into 2
      partials (client, admin)
    extracted registration forms into partials (client, admin)

    - studium modalnich dialogu (bude potreba pro rezervaci z rozvrhu, kde se
      fieldy urcite nevejdou do bunky)

  - 8-10.30
    registration by admin is done through modal dialog
    - reverted back to single events#index view, since only the actions column
      differs btw client and admin
    annotated models, factories and model specs

    registration validates free event capacity before creation
    controller shows error if registration fails
    fixed spec

    - snaha o pouziti simple_form_for pro registracni formular
    - rozsah a include_blank: false nefunguje u numerickeho pole
    - stylovani se bije s bootstrapem
