  WIP: prepared for rewriting order reversal logic ...
  - original order will not be changed on reversal - new reversal order with negative counts will be
    created and linked to the original
  - scatched Orders service spec
  - added ton of notes

  WIP: Orders.reverse_payment now generates new reversal order ...
  - Order has many reversal orders
  - reverse_payment transitions from unpayed or to_be_reversed, may_reverse_payment? overriden
  - bill doesn't negate amounts and prices - they're already negated in reversal order
  - probably broke most of the other reversal functionality

  WIP: event capacity is now deallocated on complete payment reversal ...
  - reverse_payment event no longer unconfirms order
