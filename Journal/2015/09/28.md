- 12-8 - rezervace
  mostly disabled responsiveness ...
  - disabled navbar collapsing
  - set min page width to 1000px
  - only remaining responsive behavior is switching btw 1000 and 1200 px page width
  added meta tags for better support
  added ie10 fix - stylesheet and js

  fixed user bar floating ...
  - user bar is tagged as .navbar-text.navbar-right, this tag lost its float: right when width was
    below $grid-float-breakpoint, since under this threshold, the navbar is usually collapsed and when
    expanded, items are displayed one per row
  fixed navbar item borders (makro style) - showing even on < 768px widths

  disabled responsiveness for tables ...
  - removed all table-responsive classes using js (since this comes from wice_grid and is not
    configurable)

= 8h
