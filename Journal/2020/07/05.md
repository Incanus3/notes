added basic seed to enable login

- added danube.scripts.seed_db
  - seeds data needed for waiter login
  - canteen data loading fails for now
- added recreate_clean_db shell script
  - drops existing db, creates anew, seeds structures and runs seed_db script
- added notes about cases where missing data isn't handled properly and
  we get 500 response

fixed seed-migrations script - fully qualified sequence

used `==` instead of `is` in danube.services.printer.Printer.render_line,
  since it compares integer values
