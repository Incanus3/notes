* Lisp macros vs. modern languages' metaprogramming/syntax extension mechanisms
	* [[Pocitace:Ruby:building DSLs]]

• rete/generic-node - terminology note concerning distinction between templates, facts vs. patterns, simple vs. template objects
	* should be moved to core
	* should appear in the text

* rete/graph-traversal defines cool, higher-level walk-graph function, that takes starting node and 3 other functions and can be used in many different ways - e.g. by graph->tree and graph->list
	* it's able to traverse graphs that contain cycles by memoizing the visit result for each node
	* walk-rete and rete-nodes builds on this
	* rete-copy-p uses rete-nodes to get list of the nodes, than it compares them and their neighbors
