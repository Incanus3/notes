* prace - fs
	* 2.25-3.25 vytvareni webhostingu pro bozp-olomouc.cz, deprecated comments in /etc/php/cli/conf.d/mcrypt.ini and imap.ini, deleted corosync logrotate config

* web1a - '/usr/lib/php5/20090626/sqlite.so' - /usr/lib/php5/20090626/sqlite.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory in Unknown on line 0

* I've written most of the code before even trying to write the example usage, if I started top-down (oudside-in) by first writing the examples, I could have
1) written less code - only what's needed
2) structure the code better?

* instance methods take the instance as a parameter, so even when calling from other method of the same instance, we need to pass the instance explicitly
	* other oo languages maintain a concept of implicit this or self, simplifying calling other member methods
	* we also need to explicitly specify the instance, when accessing it's slots, even from instance methods

* assert, retract, modify, defrule, deftemplate, ... are comfortable for user input and also compatible with clips syntax, but are hardly usable to be called programatically (when exil used as library or component) => **function alternatives are needed**
* parser parses facts, patterns, rules, templates, ... from symbolic expressions
* if (facts), (rules), (templates), ... methods existed and returned these symbolic expressions (not like facts, that only prints the representation now), interesting logic could be built on top of ExiL - other libraries could store and load/generate/manipulate this representation easily and if function variants existed for assert, retract, defrule, ..., (which already exist or are easy to extract, but arent exported), they could then call back to exil
* e.g. metal extraction from ore automation system exports facts about various qualities of the metal into exil symbolic representation (probably classifies numeric values) and asserts them (using function-assert), than starts the inference and after its termination gets instructions for corrections of the automated process by examining output of (facts)
'''
(defrule raise-temperature
  (coherency high)
  (temperature low)
  =>
  (retract (temperature low))
  (assert (temperature high)))

or

(defrule stop-production
  (output-containers full)
  =>
  (assert (command production stop)))
'''

* these application are a great topic to analyse in the text

* backward chaining with fact and rule matching and backtracking works - fixed on front-end layer
[ ] implement alternative answers
