=== Lisp and OOP ===
* polymorphism is one of the foundations of OOP, but since CL wasn't designed with OOP in mind, built-in types aren't polymorphic:
	* collection element access - aref, elt, nth, gethash, assoc
	* equality
		* there's 4 generic eq predicates - eq, eql, equal, equalp - why not, but these should be defined as generics and thus overridable
		* specific types - char-(not-)equal, string-(not-)equal, tree-equal
					* (/)=, char(/)=, string(/)=
		* similar for comparations
	* copying
		* copy-alist, copy-list, copy-seq, copy-structure, copy-symbol, copy-tree

=== Backward chaining ===
* environment/env-slots - dole
	* goals, find-goal, add-goal, del-goal
	* stack-for-backtrack, pop-backtrack, back-stack-matches
* environment/env-backward
* tests/environment/tst-env-backward
* examples/backward-chaining
* examples/backchain-env
