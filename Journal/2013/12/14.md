=== Pry ===
== pry-rescue ==
* play - play a line without advancing the execution
* show-source ($) without args - shows source of current method
* edit -m - edit current method
* break - really usefull breakpoints - takes method, file, line, ...
* _ex_ - last raised exception (wtf = _ex_.backtrace)
* frame, show-stack, up, down, ...

== byebug ==
* advantages over pry-byebug
  * display command - display arbitrary expression after each step - we can watch for changes, etc.
  * save [filename] - save the current state of debugging session (breakpoints, displays)
  * source [filename] - load it again
  * breakpoints can have conditionals
