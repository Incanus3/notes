http://www.opscode.com/chef/ - Chef is an automation platform that transforms infrastructure into code
Chef gives you a way to describe and automate your infrastructure and processes. Your infrastructure becomes testable, versioned and repeatable. It becomes part of your Agile process.

Chef relies on reusable definitions known as cookbooks and recipes that are written using the the Ruby programming language. Cookbooks and recipes automate common infrastructure tasks. Their definitions describe what your infrastructure consists of and how each part of your infrastructure should be deployed, configured and managed. Chef applies those definitions to servers to produce an automated infrastructure. 
* seems pretty amazing for large infrastructures
