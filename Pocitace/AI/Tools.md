### Coding agents
- https://opencode.ai/ - CLI (command & interactive) & web interface
	- integrates with most model providers and backends (both cloud and local)
- https://www.warp.dev/ - AI terminal + CLI (non-interactive)
	- just a few selected models, but mostly SOTA
- https://www.augmentcode.com - IDE plugin + CLI (command & interactive)
	- good prompt enhancement and project indexing
	- pretty good price for SOTA models (much cheaper Claude)
- https://refact.ai - IDE plugin
	- similar, but augment worked much better for me
- https://tidewave.ai/ - the coding agent for full-stack web app development 
	- very interesting integrations - can introspect most parts of your app
	- doesn't support java/kotlin yet - supports JS, python, ruby, elixir
- https://www.vibekanban.com/ - manage agent tasks as a kanban board
	- supports a lot of backends, including opencode, which supports most providers
- https://github.com/AutoMaker-Org/automaker
	- similar, nicer UI, but seems more suited for one-off jobs than for interactive work
	- doesn't support as many backends, but is adding new ones gradually
- https://github.com/different-ai/openwork - turn your opencode workflows into usable experiences for non-technical users
#### Extensions
- https://btca.dev/ - better context for your agents
	- ask questions about your libs
	- works directly with their code
- https://github.com/numman-ali/openskills - synchronize skills btw backends
### Cloud services
- https://www.daytona.io - run AI code in cloud sandbox
- https://sprites.dev/ - similar, but stateful
- https://www.coderabbit.ai/ - AI code review
- https://www.greptile.com/ - taktez, mozna o neco lepsi, ale taky drazsi
### Other stuff
- https://docs.sillytavern.app/ - locally installed user interface that allows you to interact with text generation LLMs, image generation engines, and TTS voice models
