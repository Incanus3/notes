### Main concepts and how to implement them
- `Entity` - a structure with slot metadata
	- there are basically two "structures" here:
		- the "instance" of the entity, holding actual values of the slots (+ id)
		- the "class" of the entity, holding the slot metadata
	- we'd typically represent the instance as a `Struc`
- `EntityStorage` (manager class in `qwazar`)
- `EntityStore` (manager instance in `qwazar`)
- `Repository`
- `View`
- `ViewSet`
