===== teoretic X practical, citations X practice =====
[ ] how much opinionated should a master thesis be? should it just summarize or combine respected people's facts, or can just the basic building blocks be cited and the rest opinionated?
	[ ] when highly opinionated hypoteses presented, these should be either supported by **recognizable outcomes** in the application (design flaws, etc.) or by **citations** (theoretic academical materials aren't the only material we can cite, blogs of experienced programmers from big projects should be equally valid)
