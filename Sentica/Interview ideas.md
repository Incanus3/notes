- take a fun task - sudoku implementation, colony management game, whatever
	- these have the advantage of being very flexible - you can implement them as a CLI / TUI / 2d canvas / desktop GUI app / webapp (BE rendered or BE data + FE ui)
- add some "real" stuff to it, ideally one that our product needs
	- swappable storage
	- make it client+server
	- multiplayer - auth & sessions
	- security - only some users can do some stuff
	- background jobs with observability and error handling / retries
	- TODO: find some more stuff
- let the candidate choose the tech stack
	- it doesn't need to be our stack - he can always learn that
	- if he chooses his:
		- he'll be comfortable, not hindered by lang and tools he doesn't know
		- we might learn some interesting stuff
		- it gives us something to talk about and see how he thinks
			- why did he chose which part
			- what are its advantages and its shortcomings
