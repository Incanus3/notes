### Discussion topics
- what tech stuff is he excited about, why?
- what's their stance about AIs, why?
	- if positive, which tools do you use? why?
### Practical task
- take a fun task - sudoku implementation, colony management game, whatever
	- these have the advantage of being very flexible - you can implement them as a CLI / TUI / 2d canvas / desktop GUI app / webapp (BE rendered or BE data + FE ui)
- add some "real" stuff to it, ideally one that our product needs
	- swappable storage
	- make it client+server
	- multiplayer - auth & sessions
	- security - only some users can do some stuff
	- background jobs with observability and error handling / retries
	- TODO: find some more stuff
- let the candidate choose the tech stack
	- it doesn't need to be our stack - they can always learn that
	- if they chooses his:
		- they'll be comfortable, not hindered by lang and tools they don't know
		- we might learn some interesting stuff
		- it gives us something to talk about and see how they think
			- why did they chose which part
			- what are its advantages and its shortcomings
			- what would you choose if you wanted to make it the most fun and what would you choose if you wanted to make it most practical?
